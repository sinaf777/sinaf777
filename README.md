🔥 General 2-Month Coding Roadmap
🎯 Goal: Become proficient in a programming language + build real projects + understand key CS concepts.
📅 Month 1 – Core Foundations + One Track Focus
🔹 Week 1: Choose Your Path + Master the Basics

    ✅ Pick a main language: Python, JavaScript, or C++.

    ✅ Learn syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, functions.

    📘 Recommended: W3Schools, freeCodeCamp, or Codecademy.

    ⏰ Time: 2–3 hours/day.

Mini-Project: Create a calculator or number guessing game.
🔹 Week 2: Dive Deeper

    ✅ Data structures: arrays/lists, dictionaries/maps, sets.

    ✅ String manipulation, functions, input/output.

    ✅ Practice on platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces.

Mini-Project: Build a basic to-do list CLI or webpage.
🔹 Week 3: Learn Git + Build More

    ✅ Learn Git & GitHub basics.

    ✅ Start using version control for your code.

    ✅ Study basic algorithms (sorting, searching).

    ✅ Keep solving 3–5 problems/day on LeetCode.

Mini-Project: Make a portfolio page or a simple blog.
🔹 Week 4: Choose a Focus Area

Choose one:

    🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)

    📊 Data Science (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib)

    🤖 Machine Learning (Python + Scikit-learn)

    🎮 Game Dev (Unity + C# or Pygame)

    🐧 System Programming (C/C++ or Rust)

    💻 Competitive Programming (C++ or Python)

Mini-Project: Build something aligned to your choice.
📅 Month 2 – Build Real Projects + Advanced Practice
🔹 Week 5: Real Projects Begin

    ✅ Learn frameworks (e.g., React, Flask, Django).

    ✅ Build your first serious project.

    ✅ Keep pushing to GitHub.

Project Ideas:

    Web app: Notes app / Weather app / Blog CMS

    Data: Data analysis of COVID/stock/tweet data

    CP: Solve 10+ problems on Codeforces

🔹 Week 6: Algorithms & Problem Solving

    ✅ Learn sorting (merge/quick), recursion, trees, hashmaps.

    ✅ Read from “Grokking Algorithms” or use visual tools.

    ✅ Start solving problems that involve deeper logic.

Project/Practice: Create a custom quiz app with a timer or explore linked lists and graphs.
🔹 Week 7: Polish + Collaborate

    ✅ Join a community (GitHub, Discord, Telegram coding groups).

    ✅ Contribute to an open-source project (even documentation counts).

    ✅ Review and improve your older projects.

🔹 Week 8: Portfolio & Launch

    ✅ Polish your GitHub.

    ✅ Deploy a project (Netlify, Vercel, Render, or Replit).

    ✅ Create a resume and portfolio site.

    ✅ Start applying to internships, freelancing gigs, or contributing consistently to open source.

🛠 Tools & Platforms to Use:

    IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm

    Version Control: Git + GitHub

    Practice: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces

    Tutorials: freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, YouTube (Fireship, TraversyMedia)

    Project Hosting: Netlify, Vercel, Replit, GitHub Pages

📌 Tips for Success:

    ✅ Code daily (even 1–2 hours helps).

    ✅ Don’t just watch — build.

    ✅ Debug your own errors.

    ✅ Take breaks to avoid burnout.

    ✅ Ask questions (Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, Reddit).
